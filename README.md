# Automated Irrigation System

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
An **Automated Irrigation System** that automates and controls crop irrigation based on soil moisture levels and weather conditions. This solution helps farmers conserve water, reduce labor, and optimize yields by leveraging real-time sensor and forecast data. 

## Project Proposal
- **Background**: Manual irrigation is labor-intensive and inefficient, risking over- or under-watering.  
- **Solution**: Automate watering decisions using soil moisture sensors and weather data to optimize irrigation schedules.

## Functional Requirements
- **User Registration & Login** (with email verification, social login)  
- **Weather Forecast** (real-time current and 7-day view)  
- **Settings** (location, language, profile management, password change)  
- **Community Feedback** (ratings, reviews, developer responses)  
- **Soil Moisture Monitoring** (live and historical data)  
- **Notifications** (weather alerts, news, support responses)  
- **Helpline Access** (phone, email, FAQs)  
- **Irrigation Control**  
  - Auto On/Off based on schedule and conditions  
  - Manual control  
  - Timer and water-level settings
